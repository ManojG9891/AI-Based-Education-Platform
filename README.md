# AI Based Education Platform

## Overview

The AI Based Education Platform is an innovative AI-driven solution designed to revolutionize traditional career counseling and document interaction [1]. By integrating machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and AI algorithms, this platform offers highly personalized career recommendations based on individual qualifications, preferences, and goals [1]. It also provides an efficient document query system, allowing users to upload and interact with documents to quickly extract relevant information [1].

## Features

*   **Personalized Career Recommendations:**
    *   Suggests tailored career paths based on user inputs like skills, experience, and aspirations [1].
    *   Utilizes machine learning algorithms (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity, Fuzzy Matching) to match users with suitable career options [1].
    *   Provides recommendations for relevant courses, certifications, and career roadmaps [1].
*   **AI-Powered Document Query:**
    *   Enables users to upload documents (e.g., PDFs) and ask questions to receive context-aware answers [1].
    *   Leverages NLP models (including the Gemini API) to process documents and generate relevant responses [1].
    *   Facilitates efficient information retrieval from large volumes of text [1].

## Installation

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to install the project.  For example:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [your_repository_url]
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd [project_directory]
    ```
3.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   *(See Dependencies section for more details.)*

## Usage

Explain how to use the platform. Include examples of how to provide input and interpret the output.

1.  **Running the Application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py  # Or whatever command starts your application
    ```
2.  **Accessing the Platform:** Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:[port_number]` [1].
3.  **Career Guidance:**
    *   Enter your information (current domain, area of interest, career aspirations, excelled subjects, long-term vision) in the provided form [1].
    *   Click "Submit" to receive personalized career recommendations, including courses, certifications, and a career roadmap [1]. See figures 6.5 (c), (d) and (e) [1].
4.  **Document Query:**
    *   Upload a PDF document [1].
    *   Enter your question related to the document's content [1].
    *   Click "Submit" to receive an AI-generated answer [1]. See figures 6.5 (f) and (g) [1].

## System Architecture

The platform is built with a modular architecture, comprising a Flask-based backend and a user-friendly web interface [1]. The backend integrates the Career Recommendation Engine and the Answer Generation Engine, ensuring seamless operation [1]. The system uses a central database to store user information, career data, and uploaded documents [1].

## Components

*   **Career Recommendation Engine:**  Uses TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity, and Fuzzy Matching to provide personalized career suggestions [1].
*   **Answer Generation Engine:** Leverages NLP techniques and the Gemini API to process user queries and extract relevant information from PDF documents [1].
